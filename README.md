👋 Hello! I'm a passionate **data scientist** with a strong focus on **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and cutting-edge technologies like **natural language processing (NLP)** and **computer vision**. My work revolves around developing models that leverage structured and unstructured data to drive insights, automate decision-making, and solve real-world problems.

🌐 I'm experienced in using popular frameworks such as **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **Hugging Face** to build and fine-tune models, whether it’s for image classification, object detection, large language models, or large-scale data analytics in the **cloud**. From deploying models to cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Azure** to handling large datasets, I enjoy the end-to-end machine learning pipeline.

📊 When I’m not working on model training or optimization, I’m diving deep into **data exploration**, creating **data visualizations**, and sharing code snippets related to **computer vision**, **NLP**, and **LLM-based solutions**. I’m also a big advocate for **open-source projects** and collaboration within the data science community.
